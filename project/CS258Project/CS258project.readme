## CS 258 Project Assignment

### Files and Description:

1. **Client.java**: Contains the implementation code for the client.
2. **Server.java**: Contains the implementation code for the server.
3. **CCS258Project.pdf**: Contains necessary screenshots and graphs required for the project rubric.
4. **CCS258projectgraph.ipynb**: Contains Python code to plot graphs from the output files generated by the client-server implementation programs.

### Prerequisites:

1. Two computers with Java JDK installed.
2. Stable internet connection.

### How to Run:

#### Setup:

1. **Client Side**:
   - Copy the `Client.java` code to one of the computers acting as a client.
   - Ensure to input the proper IPv4 address of the client system in the code.
   - Change the location of the output files to your desired location (ensure not to change the names of the CSV files).

2. **Server Side**:
   - Connect the server computer to a network and enable hotspot for the client to connect.
   
#### Execution:

1. **Compile Programs**:
   - Compile both Java codes (`Client.java` and `Server.java`). Ensure the programs compile without any errors.

2. **Run Server**:
   - Execute the server program. It will prompt in the terminal indicating that it's up and running.

3. **Run Client**:
   - Execute the client program. It will connect to the server, and transmission of packets will begin.

4. **Halting Execution**:
   - To halt the execution, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the programs are running.

5. **View Output**:
   - After both programs finish execution, check for the desired output.
   - Notice that three files (`packet_retransmissions_log.csv`, `congestion_window_sizes.csv`, `dropped_packets_log.csv`) have been generated in the specified folder.

#### Graph Generation:

1. **Open Notebook**:
   - Use a notebook environment, preferably Google Colab, to open `CCS258projectgraph.ipynb`.

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload all three CSV files generated by the client-server programs into the notebook.

3. **Run Code**:
   - Run the provided Python code in the notebook.
   - This code will generate the three graphs required based on the data from the uploaded CSV files.

### Conclusion:

Follow these steps to successfully execute and analyze the client-server implementation project for CS 258. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the project documentation (`CCS258Project.pdf`) for further guidance.
